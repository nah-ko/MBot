<P>
<b>mbot</b> is intended to be a generic purpose mail robot, and it is
written in python.

At first, we want it to provide simple internet access via mail, for
people having only mail and wanting to get updated online docs&nbsp;!

<P>
General design&nbsp;:
<ul>
	<li>The bot is installed by adding a <tt>| alias</tt> on your MTA</li>

	<li> You then send mail to say <tt>mbot@domain.tld</tt>,
	with the command you want the bot to handle as the subject,
	and its arguments in the body, for the moment one per line.</li>

	<li>mbot then send you back a mail with multi-part data containing the
     result of your queries.</li>
</ul>

<P>
As I write this little presentation page, 3 handlers have been
written&nbsp;:
<ul>
	<li><u>wget</u> to get a page given its url. The data mime-type will
	be respected when received by the response mail, so you can get PDF
	documents, images or whatever you want...</li>
	<li><u>google</u> to make a request to the well known search
	engine.</li>
	<li><u>news</u> to update a news data-base with text and optionnaly
	some images too. Then you set up a dynamic web page using those
	data, and you can manage updating your news section by mail.</li>
</ul>
<P>
We may later on provide a kind of command line interface, or even an
internet proxy, in order to make the mail transport as transparent as
possible.
