General
-=-=-=-
 . Support GnuPG, that is checking for uid in a keyring and optionnaly
   make mbot sign its answers

 . Plan to support i18n in messages, debian package and help files

 . Make a web page, design a logo (in SVG, of course)


Global configuration
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 . The section name should not depend on the subjet to match

   Then mbot will use the first section in the config matching the
   received mail (alias, from, subject and lists must all match)

      [MySection]
      alias     =
      subject   =
      whitelist = 
      blacklist =
      ...

   See thereafter for details on some new config elements.


Per handler configuration
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 . Add a Subject element containing a list of regexp for subject
   matching

      subject = ["wget.*", "fetchurl.*"]

 . Add a From element containing a list of aliases to match,
   defaulting to '*', thus allowing to configure multiple aliases in
   the same file.

      alias = [dict@server.tld, webster@server.tld]

 . Add a policy element indicating how to answer a mail, for example
   allowing not to anwser to blacklisted people

      policy = ignore_blacklist

 . Add a Lang element containing the language to be used by mbot when
   sending back messages to sender, choose a sensitive default (fr, as
   the developpers are frenchies ?)

      lang = fr

 . Split actual configuration file into one per handler, as example. So
   admin who use mbot will have to read each of these examples to make
   it's own configuration file.


Handlers
-=-=-=-=-
 . Provide a plugin subdir where to place handlers, each in its subdir

      mbot/
        handlers/
          web/
	    web_example.conf
            UrlHandler.py
            GoogleHandler.py
          news/
	    news_example.conf
            NewsHandler.py
            PgNewsHandler.py
            MyNewsHandler.py
          dict/
            ...

 . Then package handlers separatly, managing dependencies for each of
   them.

      mbot - multi purpose Mail roBOT
      mbot-web - web handlers (wget, google) for mbot
      mbot-news - manage news by mail using PostgreSQL or MySQL
      mbot-explotf - update your explotf web photo gallery by mail

 . UrlHandler, GoogleHandler (mbot-web)

   Add a config element to set the 'User-Agent' to use, defaulting to
   'mbot' allong with our web page url.


New Handlers
-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 . HelpHandler

   Each handler should provide a user-guide.lang providing some text
   to explain how to use it.

   Then you can mail mbot with the subject 'help wget' to get the help
   message for the handler configured to answer to your message, but
   matching on the 'wget' subject.

 . ExploTfHandler

   This handler will receive some photos to publish with ExploTF, and
   place them in the wanted album. The photos should be sent all in a
   .zip file or attached in a mime multipart email.

   See http://explotf.gouteix.com/contents/index.en.html for further
   information on the ExploTF software.

   Note: we may have to debian package explotf to satisfy the
   mbot-explotf recommends dependency.

 . BlogHandler

   Support some of the blog tools in usage out there...

 . Maporama

   This handler should allow for maporama consultation by email.
   See http://maporama.com

 . CiteFutee

   This handler should allow for citefutee services usage by email.
   See http://citefutee.com/
