mbot is intended to be a generic purpose mail robot, written in python.

At first, we want it to provide simple internet access via mail, for
people having only mail and wanting to get updated online docs !

So the firsts mail handlers written are google and wget !

General design :

 . The bot is installed by adding a | alias on your MTA

 . You then send mail to say mbot@domain.tld, with the command you want
 the bot to handle as the subject, and its arguments in the body, for
 the moment one per line.

 . mbot then send you back a mail with multi part data containing the
 result of your queries.


We may later on provide a kind of command line interface, or even an
internet proxy, in order to make the mail transport as transparent as
possible.
