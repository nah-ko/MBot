INSTALLING MBOT

$Id$

mbot is a mail bot, and is easily installable on your system, provided
it has a mail server running and accepting mails from the outside.

As the primary intended purpose of mbot is giving internet access to
people having only mail, it may be of no interest to install this on a
stand alone computer.

To install that mail bot, just add a line in your mail alias file:
  mbot: "|/path/to/mbot/mbot.py -c /path/to/mbot.conf"

If you use exim, be sure to add the option 'pipe_as_creator' to your
configuration, in the 'address_pipe' section

In order to user NewsHandler you should use sql table cration who are in
news directory. One for each server type, MySQL or PostgreSQL.

ATTENTION !
This version will work with python 2.3.
Please take care of deps file which give modules dependancies.
